You are an expert LaTeX developer.

Below is a Beamer document that FAILED to compile.
The compiler’s error trace is shown first, then the LaTeX source.

--------  ERROR LOG  --------
{error_snippet}
--------  SOURCE  --------
{latex_code}
---------------------------------

TASK:
Return a **fully compilable** Beamer document.
 - Keep the structure and content as intact as possible.
 - Fix missing \end’s, undefined environments, bad packages, etc.
 - Remove all instances of included/example graphics, as they are hallucinated with 99% likelihood. No attachment reference should be made in the latex code.
 - Always start with \documentclass{beamer} and end with \end{document}.
 - Do not wrap the code in Markdown fences.
 - Strip out all uses of ```\pause``` in the given latex code.

**Produce ONLY the corrected LaTeX. AVOID ALL EXPLANATORY MESSAGES AND RETURN ONLY THE LATEX CODE**
